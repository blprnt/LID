Living in Data
Code Repository

**Introduction**

This repository holds the code, data, and resources used to produce the graphics for the book Living in Data. In another more peaceful world, full of joy and love and abundant nudibranchs, all of this code would be clean and well-commented and I'd be available for support questions whenever anyone needed help. In this world, things are pretty messy. I've done my best to make the code useable.

The vast majority of the graphics were made with [Processing](https://processing.org/), which is a java-based framework for coding built for the visual arts. 

Why Processing? 

First, it outputs well to .PDFs and high-resolution bitmaps which made it a nice tool to use for a book. Mostly though, it's a tool that I've used for many years and it's the place I feel most comfortable messing around.

**Notes**

OK, so first thing:

All of the URLs in the book are incorrect. I'll just take a minute in shame for you to read this while I weep softly.

But, they're easy to find. A URL in the book that is github.com/blprnt/LID/CHAPTER is actually github.com/blprnt/LID/tree/main/CHAPTER. Here they all are:
