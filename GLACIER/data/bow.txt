If you’re reading this in the spring, meltwater is beginning to`
flow from the ice and down to the lake, tumbling down a series`
of waterfalls. The water carries with it dust, tiny motes of rock`
scraped from the rock bed, evidence of the glacier’s heavy move-`
ment. In streams, this “rock flour” gives the water the appearance`
of diluted milk. Down in the lake, the particulate collects to color`
the water a brilliant, unforgettable turquoise. To the southeast,`
water drains into the Bow River, which elbows through Lake`
Louise and Banff and Canmore and Cochrane and Calgary, on its`
way to Hudson Bay. If you drink a glass of water today in Calgary,`
there’s about a fifty-fifty chance you’re tasting some of the gla-`
cier. If you’ve lived in the city your whole life, your body is infused`
with those blue limestone molecules. The mountains are, quite lit-`
erally, in your bones.~


It takes some time for the water from the glacier to make it to`
the city. If you dropped a small toy boat into Bow Lake on a Sun-`
day morning, and if it was lucky enough not to get caught up or`
sunk along the way, you could step out onto the Peace Bridge in`
Calgary early Wednesday evening and watch it drift below you. If`
you’re not that patient, put the boat in your car, pull off the gravel`
shoulder and onto the Icefields Parkway, and drive southeast from`
the lake to the city. It would take you two and a half hours, if the`
traffic wasn’t too bad.~

I have a print of a black-and-white photograph of the Bow Gla-`
cier taken almost a hundred years ago. In it, a man stands, hands`
in pockets, gazing over the lake and up to the ice. Beside him is a`
large teepee, pitched on a gravel island. In the foreground, both`
the teepee and a piece of the mountain are reflected in still water.`
It’s a gorgeous image. In it, the Bow Glacier is massive. It seems`
hardly held back by the peaks to its right and left, and it pours`
in three great channels into the valley below. Above the tree line,`
everything is scraped clean, scoured by thousands of years of ice.~
