His remark was not as callous as it sounds; he was talking about upper-income taxpayers. But the policy he proposes is callous. Indeed, it would be far more devastating than Washington's refusal to help during the 1975 fiscal crisis, which prompted the famous Daily News headline ''Ford to City: Drop Dead.''",,
